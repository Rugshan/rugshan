### Hey, I'm Rugshan

- I'm a Computer Engineering (Software Concentration) student at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) graduating in Fall of 2022.
- You can find all of the apps I've tinkered with throughout my undergrad years, some from school projects, and a lot from Udemy courses.
- I enjoy learning new languages and creating software applications. I use GitHub as my number one version control software, but also as a way to track my growth as a developer.
- I wish you all goodluck and thanks for visiting my profile ðŸ˜„
